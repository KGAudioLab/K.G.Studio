## K.G.Studio ‚Äî A Browser-based DAW with AI Assistant

K.G.Studio is a lightweight, modern DAW that runs entirely in the browser with **K.G.Studio Musician Assistant** at its core. It features realistic instrument playback via Tone.js samplers, a piano‚Äëroll editor, track and region management with full undo/redo, project persistence to IndexedDB, a configurable settings panel, and an integrated AI assistant with tool execution.

**K.G.Studio Musician Assistant** is an AI assistance agent for harmony, arrangement, and note editing ‚Äî but not full auto‚Äëcomposition.

## Project Status

**K.G.Studio is an experimental project in early development.** We're exploring the possibilities of integrating AI agents and LLMs into music production workflows ‚Äî essentially building a "Cursor or Claude Code for DAW" experience. 

This project investigates how AI-human collaboration can enhance creative music-making, from intelligent harmony suggestions to automated editing tasks. As an experimental platform, expect frequent changes, evolving features, and occasional instability as we push the boundaries of what's possible in AI-assisted music production.

## Getting Started

### Or clone and run locally:
```bash
# Make sure you have Node.js >= 20.19.3 installed
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KGAudioLab/KGStudio {your-local-path}
cd {your-local-path}

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

K.G.Studio loads defaults from `./public/config.json` (with an internal fallback) and persists user edits in the browser via `ConfigManager` + IndexedDB. IndexedDB is your browser‚Äôs own local database stored on your device; it does not leave your machine and is cleared if you clear this site‚Äôs data. Modify settings via the in‚Äëapp Settings panel.

- **General**
  - LLM provider: OpenAI, or OpenAI‚Äëcompatible
  - API keys and models for the selected provider
  - OpenAI‚Äëcompatible base URL (for self‚Äëhosted gateways)
  - Soundfont base URL (CDN for instrument samples)
- **Behavior**
  - Chatbox default open on startup
- **Templates**
  - Custom instructions used by the AI assistant

### Connectivity & Privacy

- K.G.Studio is fully client‚Äëside. No first‚Äëparty servers are required to run the app.
- All projects, configuration, and UI state are stored in your browser‚Äôs IndexedDB (on your device).
- Network access is only used for:
  - Downloading instrument sound samples from the configured soundfont CDN
  - Communicating with the LLM provider you select (e.g., OpenAI or OpenAI‚Äëcompatible services)
- Outside of the two cases above, the app functions locally. If you block those endpoints, the app still loads; instrument playback and AI features will not function until network access is restored.
- For security, when running from a non‚Äëlocal host we do not persist your API key in IndexedDB (to reduce XSS risk). You‚Äôll be prompted to enter it each time you start K.G.Studio.

- Click the "+" button or `/clear` command to clear the chat history.

### Configuring Your LLM Provider

Navigate to **Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí General ‚Üí LLM Provider**. Depending on your chosen provider, you will need to supply the appropriate API Key and, if applicable, a custom base URL (for non-official OpenAI-compatible services such as Ollama, OpenRouter, etc.).

Note: due to CORS limitations with some providers, Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude are currently supported via OpenRouter only.

### Using OpenAI models

1. Obtain an OpenAI API Key from [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You may need to create an account and add a payment method to generate an API Key.
2. In **Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí General ‚Üí LLM Provider**, select **OpenAI** as your provider.
3. Enter your API Key in **OpenAI ‚Üí Key**.
4. Select your preferred model from the **OpenAI ‚Üí Model** dropdown. For optimal performance, we recommend `gpt‚Äë4o`. (`gpt‚Äë5` is still being evaluated.)
5. Optionally, choose whether to enable Flex Mode in **OpenAI ‚Üí Flex Mode**. Flex Mode offers discounted pricing, but may result in slower response times or server-side errors.

### Using OpenRouter

OpenRouter is a platform that provides unified access to a wide range of language models‚Äîincluding free options‚Äîfrom various providers. This makes it easy to experiment and find the model that best suits your needs.

1. Obtain an API Key from [**OpenRouter**](https://openrouter.ai/keys). Registration is required; for paid models, a payment method may also be necessary.
2. In **Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí General ‚Üí LLM Provider**, select **OpenAI Compatible** as your provider.
3. Enter your API Key in **OpenAI Compatible Server ‚Üí Key**.
4. Browse available models on the [**OpenRouter Models Page**](https://openrouter.ai/models). Use the "Prompt Pricing" filter to identify free models.  
   **Note:** Each model provider may have different data retention and privacy policies. Please review these policies before use.
5. Enter your chosen model name in **OpenAI Compatible Server ‚Üí Model**. Recommended model series include:
    - `Anthropic: claude-4-sonnet` (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`: [Link](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4))
    - `Qwen: qwen3-30b-a3b` (FREE MODEL: `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b:free`: [Link](https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b:free))
    - `Qwen: qwen3-235b-a22b` (FREE MODEL: `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b:free`: [Link](https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b:free))
6. Input the base URL `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` **OpenAI Compatible Server ‚Üí Base URL**.

### About the agent and LLM providers

Currently, based on our evaluation, OpenAI‚Äôs open‚Äësource models (`gpt‚Äëoss‚Äë20b` and `gpt‚Äëoss‚Äë120b`) are not yet compatible with the current agent implementation; support is planned.

For security, when using K.G.Studio from a non‚Äëlocal host, API keys are not persisted in IndexedDB; you will need to input your API key each time you start K.G.Studio.

K.G.Studio does not provide or host any of the models listed above, nor is it affiliated with any model provider. All data is stored locally on your device; K.G.Studio does not collect or transmit your data. You are solely responsible for any data you provide to third‚Äëparty model providers.
